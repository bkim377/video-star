# VideoStar - A Full Stack React App

This is a Full Stack application that follows the [MVC (Model View Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) software design pattern. This app uses: 
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) is the front-end library that is acting as the __View__.
* [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) is the web server that is acting as the __Controller__.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is the database server that is acting as the __Model__.

This app contains React components, helper/util functions, and uses React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Node, Express and MongoDB are used in the backend so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
